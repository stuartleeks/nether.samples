# Higher or Lower

This sample is a simple in-browser game that uses the nether JavaScript SDK.

The instructions below show how to run this sample and the nether API locally.

Before proceding, you should clone the [nether](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/nether) repo and ensure that you are able to run that successfully.

## Running the sample (PowerShell)

Open a PowerShell window and run `scripts\setnetherconfig.ps1`. This sets environment variables to configure nether to allow the sample to connect.
In the same window, launch nether via the `rundev.ps1` script.


Now that you have nether running, create a new PowerShell window and run `scripts\rungame.ps1` to launch the game.
